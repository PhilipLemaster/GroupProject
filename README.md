# Retro City
***
## Description
This project was a ton of fun to work on. Utilizing both the VGDB and Gamespot APIs, Retro City is a comprehensive database of Retro games featuring general information such as ratings, screenshots, and descriptions: all in a minimalistic and vibrantly stylized shell. Utilizing local storage, a user can save a list of favorite games for later viewing. Search options are available for filtering by name, genre, and platform, though all three parameters cannot be used at the moment, given that they pull from different API requests.
